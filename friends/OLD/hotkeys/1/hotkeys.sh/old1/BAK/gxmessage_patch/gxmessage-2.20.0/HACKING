* In gxmessage.c's main(), the default "okay:0" string is intentionally
  hard-wired to avoid breaking scripts that make use of xmessage's -print
  option. Please do not change or gettextize this string.

* To quit the program, call prog_cleanup() rather than exit().
  prog_cleanup() correctly exits with the current value of gx.exit_code.

* To keep this package in good shape, please keep the copyright notices
  updated, check that any newly added files have proper licence info,
  and use the latest stuff from gnulib.
