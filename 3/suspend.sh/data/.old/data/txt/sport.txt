do something exciting - and do it whenever you choose
read about the oldest physics - but try to invent the newer 
move your hands around your ass
jump up - try to reach higher
lift the body upwards - and stand up
look around with your neck and take a deep breath
sit straight - and open your ears
close your eyes and scream - but do it silently
stretch your hands to your sides
think slowly - buy do it faster
sit and only than - do it on the best side
think twice and even three times
move your spine and cry
where is your pillow for your back ?
