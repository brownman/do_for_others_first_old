we will be happy as we are now and even more
you will hear about us
read about old physics - but try to understand the newer 
think twice and even three times
close your eyes and scream - but do it silently
one can jump and run - and never reach his goal - stop for a minute and think
lift the body upwards - and stand up
was I played well 
I didn't do it - but I will do it
look around with your neck and take a deep breath
some people - think that green is red
close your eyes and scream - but do it silently
my beloved wife
lift the body upwards - and stand up
I'm a human being
think slowly - buy do it faster
I am contented and you too
move your hands around your ass
you did a good choice
can you do this for me 
I swear all gods 
OK - I will do it for her
was I played well
