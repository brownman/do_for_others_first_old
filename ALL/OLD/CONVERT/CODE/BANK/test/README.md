testing
==
- don't test scripts
- test the peaces of codes that the script is utilizing.


todo:
==
- test self.cfg - a script should be self-aware:
- e.g: 
```
`cat $0 | grep help`
```
- a script which is not a part of a package must document in its own comments - stuff like: help/example/depend_on_packages/depend_on_process
