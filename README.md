==
I think that above all motivations gathers during the years - this sentance rule them all.
Nothing makes you feel better than if you decide doing something for someone else's good being.
so let's do it together for the benefits of all of us :)


MOTIVATION:
=
- how to stop being a complete IDIOT: A guide from a caring heart:
- 3 steps machanism - A method for bringing life to a thought


THE PROBLEM:
= 
- you have many ideas
- you keep bumping into interesting concepts
- but -
- soon you loose them !
- you keep on failing of trying to document your idea
- you keep on saving new browser's favorites in an un
- and everything gets lost
- your ideas fades away
- your enthusiasm is soon forgotten
- you have a silly or a smart question and you forgive yourself and let it fly away

PROVIDED SOLUTION:
=
- save your thoughts - damn it!
- treat your new question as a baby
- every child deserve to grow!
- write them all down - they are important as much as you are.
- collabrate your small steps with others.
- share your light.




-3- Easy Steps Mechanism:
---

1) IMAGINE FIRST
=
- believe that it's worthy And Catch the flying Idea!
- press a key combination - And - write it down
--
technical details:
--
1. a new throught just bumbed into your head
2. you decide to document it
3. you use a key-combination - as a rescue key
4. a new dialog window popped up
5. you fill up a small form - and press save
6. fantastic.

2) MAGNIFY THE SMALL
====
- go back to the idea 
- magnify the small idea By forming an actual script based upon it.

3) DO FOR OTHERS FIRST 
-
- create a list of tasks - and run them in a loop - a single task is actualy a link to a script 
- e.g: 
1. suspend the computer every 5 minutes
2. use text-to-speach engine to tell me 'you are a genius' every 2 minutes
3. repeat the last step - but this time - translate the sentance to german before speaking it
