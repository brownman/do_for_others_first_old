.SH NAME
chkwtmp \- check wtmp-file for deleted entries
.SH SYNOPSIS
.na
.B chkwtmp

.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
\fIChkwtmp\fP examines the file \fI/var/log/wtmp\fP for entries with no
information (containing only null-bytes). If such entries are found the
program prints the time window for the original entry. This is done
by displaying the timestamps of the wtmp-entry before and after the 
deleted entry.

To run chkwtmp you need read permission on the file /var/log/wtmp.
Normally this file is world-readable and no special privileges are 
required to run the checker.

An entry is recognized as overwritten if the time-information has been
overwritten with null-bytes.

This program was designed to run on SunOS 4.x systems only. On other 
systems the output is undefined...
