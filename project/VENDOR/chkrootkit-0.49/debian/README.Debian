README.Debian for chkrootkit
----------------------------

if chkrootkit says that it may have found a rootkit, "don't panic."
first, inspect your system and make sure that chkrootkit hasn't found a
false positive.  by design, chkrootkit is a bit trigger happy.  it's
better to be safe than to be sorry, i suppose.

please see README.FALSE-POSITIVES for a brief discussion on false
positives and a list of know packages that cause false positives.
