.SH NAME
chklastlog \- check lastlog-file for deleted entries
.SH SYNOPSIS

.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
\fIChklastlog\fP is reading all entries from the file \fI/var/log/wtmp\fP 
(file with informations about logins and logouts) and checks for every user
found in this file whether there is an entry in the file 
\fI/var/log/lastlog\fP, too. The program will complain about userids with
logins but no lastlogin information.

To run chklastlog you need read permission on the files /var/log/wtmp
and /var/log/lastlogin. Normally these files are world-readable and
no special privileges are required to run the checker.
